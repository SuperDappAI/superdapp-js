## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Private Disclosure

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to: security@superdapp.com
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Affected versions
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested mitigation (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Release**: As soon as safely possible

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass
- **High**: Privilege escalation, data leakage
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, moderate impact
- **Low**: Minor security improvements

## Security Best Practices

### For SDK Users

1. **API Token Security**
   - Never commit API tokens to version control
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Use least-privilege access

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Validate all environment variables
   - Use secure defaults
   - Enable debug logging only in development

3. **Deployment Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Enable proper CORS settings
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Monitor for unusual activity

4. **Code Security**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use npm audit regularly
   - Validate user inputs
   - Sanitize message content

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**
   - All PRs require review
   - Security-focused code review
   - Automated security scanning

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - License compliance

3. **Testing**
   - Security test cases
   - Penetration testing
   - Input validation tests

## Common Vulnerabilities

### API Token Exposure
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to bot APIs
- **Prevention**: Use environment variables, never log tokens
- **Detection**: Scan code for hardcoded secrets

### Message Injection
- **Risk**: Malicious content in messages
- **Prevention**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **Detection**: Content filtering and validation

### Dependency Vulnerabilities
- **Risk**: Known vulnerabilities in packages
- **Prevention**: Regular updates, audit checks
- **Detection**: Automated scanning tools
